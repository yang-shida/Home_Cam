ESP32:
    - in setup, generate a http request to backend to ask for current setting
        - if get response, update setting
        - if not, use default setting

Frontend:
    - refresh camera button
    - max frame size = 9 to be safe

Backend:
    - on startup, search subnet to find online cameras
        - for each camera
            - if its setting exists, update its setting
            - else, create default setting and update its setting
    - check every 15 minutes to see if any new camera is online (search subnet)
        - for each camera
            - if already running, do nothing
            - else
                - if its setting exists, update its setting
                - else, create default setting and update its setting
    - when a camera asks for settings, add it (setting and running) if it is not already in system
    - if receive refresh command from Frontend, search subnet for cameras 
    - for each camera
        - download image every 100ms
            - if download fail, duplicate previous image
            - if fail more than 10 times in a row, remove this camera since it might be offline
        - log image info into database
        - check if capacity is close to full, delete old image if necessary (need to update database)
